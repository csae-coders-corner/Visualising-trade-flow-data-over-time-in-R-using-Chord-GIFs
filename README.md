# Visualising-trade-flow-data-over-time-in-R-using-Chord-GIFs

It's hard to satisfactorily summarise and visualise data in three dimensions. Specifically here we are concerned with flow data over time. That is imagine we have some unit, often a geography or individual, say countries. We are interested in the flows of something (goods, migration, information whatever) between countries and how it has changed over time.

The best way I have found of visualising this data is in a Chord diagram animation - a GIF. Download the zip file to access the web file to view this post.
